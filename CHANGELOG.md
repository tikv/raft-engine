# Raft Engine Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Bug Fixes

* Unconditionally tolerate `fallocate` failures as a fix to its portability issue. Errors other than `EOPNOTSUPP` will still emit a warning.
* Avoid leaving fractured write after failure by reseeking the file writer. Panic if the reseek fails as well.

### New Features

* Add `PerfContext` which records detailed time breakdown of the write process to thread-local storage.
* Support recycling obsolete log files to reduce the cost of `fallocate`-ing new ones.

### Public API Changes

* Add `is_empty` to `Engine` API.
* Add metadata deletion capability to `FileSystem` trait. Users can implement `exists_metadata` and `delete_metadata` to clean up obsolete metadata from older versions of Raft Engine.
* Add `Engine::scan_messages` and `Engine::scan_raw_messages` for iterating over written key-values. 
* Add `Engine::get` for getting raw value.
* Move `sync` from `env::WriteExt` to `env::Handle`.
* Deprecate `bytes_per_sync`.

### Behavior Changes

* Change format version to 2 from 1 by default.
* Enable log recycling by default.
